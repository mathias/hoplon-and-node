# hoplon-and-node

A demo of a Hoplon page being served by a ClojureScript node app.

## Usage

### Node server

Install the node dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Compile the ClojureScript for the node app with:

```bash
lein cljsbuild once
```

Now run the node app:

```bash
node src/js/node.js
```

### Hoplon page

Now you should be able to load http://localhost:3000 and see the example app!
